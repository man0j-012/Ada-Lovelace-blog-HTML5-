# ADA LOVELACE Blog

## Introduction
Welcome to the ADA LOVELACE Blog project! This project is a tribute to Ada Lovelace, often considered the first computer programmer. Our blog is built with HTML5 and showcases various modern web development techniques. 
It features a responsive layout, making use of elements such as paragraphs, ordered lists, source attributes, headers, navigation, divs, and asides.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that our blog looks great on devices of all sizes.
- **HTML5 Elements**: Use of semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and readability.
- **Accessibility**: We've made sure that our blog is accessible to as many people as possible, adhering to WCAG guidelines.

## How to Use
To view the blog, simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. You can navigate through the blog using the navigation bar, and enjoy articles and insights about Ada Lovelace and the history of computing.
